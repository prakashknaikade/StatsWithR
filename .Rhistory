### Exercise 1: Getting started
###############
## a) Look at your current working directory.
getwd()
## b) Get help with this function.
help("getwd")
## c) Change your working directory to another directory.
setwd("E:/study_projects/WS22-23/StatsR")
x <- seq(-4,4, 0.1)
## b) Now we need to obtain the y-values of the plot (the density). We do this
##    using the density function for the normal distribution.
##    Use "help(dnorm)" to find out about the standard functions for the normal
##    distribution.
help("dnorm")
## c) Now use plot() to plot the normal distribution for z values of "x".
plot(x,dnorm(x))
## d) The plot now has a relatively short y-range, and it contains circles
##    instead of a line.
##    Using plot(), specify the y axis to range from 0 to 0.6, and plot a line
##    instead of the circles.
plot(x, dnorm(x), type = "l", ylim = c(0, 0.6))
## e) We want to have a vertical line to represent the mean of our distribution.
##    'abline()' can do this for us. Look up help for abline().
##    Use abline() to create the vertical line. Specify the mean of x using
##    the argument 'v'.
##    In order to get a dashed line, set the argument 'lty' to 2.
abline(v = mean(x), lty = 2)
## f) Take a look at the beaver2 dataset. (You can see it by typing "beaver2".)
##    Then select only the temperature part and store it in a variable "b2temp".
glimpse(beaver2)
b2temp <- beaver2$temp
## g) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of this dataset and plot a normal
##    distribution with these parameters.
b_mean <- mean(b2temp)
b_SD <- sd(b2temp)
plot(b2temp, dnorm(b2temp, mean = b_mean, sd = b_SD))
1 - pnorm(38.13, b_mean, b_SD) #=0.116 that the value is 38.13 or higher
pnorm(36.81, b_mean, b_SD) #=0.0391 that the value is 36.81 or lower
sample1 <- rnorm(20, b_mean, b_SD)
sample2 <- rnorm(20, b_mean, b_SD)
sample3 <- rnorm(20, b_mean, b_SD)
sample4 <- rnorm(20, b_mean, b_SD)
sample5 <- rnorm(20, b_mean, b_SD)
hist(sample1, xlim = c(36,39), breaks = 10)
hist(sample2, xlim = c(36,39), breaks = 10)
hist(sample3, xlim = c(36,39), breaks = 10)
hist(sample4, xlim = c(36,39), breaks = 10)
hist(sample5, xlim = c(36,39), breaks = 10)
## a) Install the package "languageR" and load it.
install.packages("languageR")
library(languageR)
data(package = "languageR")
head(selfPacedReadingHeid) #shows first 6 samples
tail(selfPacedReadingHeid) #shows last 6 samples
summary(selfPacedReadingHeid)
PP002 <- selfPacedReadingHeid %>%
subset(Subject == "PP002")
hist(PP002$RT)
plot(density(PP002$RT))
## b) The researcher is also interested in whether story telling is related to
##    their reading habits. As a proxy, she asked the children, whether they have
##    a library card. The following line codes that the first 13 observations are
##    from children with library card (Y) and the remaining 13 from children
##    without (N). What measurements scale does this variable have?
lib = c(rep("Y",13),rep("N",13))
pps <- c(1:26)
obs <- c(18, 15, 18, 19, 22, 17, 18, 26, 17, 14, 16, 16, 17, 21, 23, 16, 20, 21, 20, 20, 15, 17, 17, 18, 20, 24)
stories <- data.frame(pps, obs, lib)
summary(stories)
lapply(stories, class)
stories$pps <- as.factor(stories$pps) #we get more information about the levels
stories$lib <- as.factor(stories$lib) #the n and y also gets encoded in 1 and 2
lapply(stories, class)
boxplot(stories$obs ~ stories$lib, xlab = "lib", ylab = "observation")
ymean <- mean(filter(stories, lib == "Y")$obs)
ymedian <- median(filter(stories, lib == "Y")$obs)
#mean = 17.92
#mean = 17.92
#median = 17
#mean = 17.92
#median = 17
#They used the median. They are calculated different.
#mean = 17.92
#median = 17
#They used the median. They are calculated different.
#The mean gives the avg, but the median returns the value in the middle of our sorted data
## b) Get help with this function.
help("getwd")
## c) Change your working directory to another directory.
setwd("E:/study_projects/StatsWithR")
## c) Change your working directory to another directory.
setwd("E:/PKN/study_projects/StatsWithR")
## c) Change your working directory to another directory.
setwd("E:\study_projects\StatisticsWithR")
## c) Change your working directory to another directory.
setwd("E:/study_projects/StatisticsWithR")
